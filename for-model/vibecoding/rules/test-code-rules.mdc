When generating test code for the project, you must create it based on the content and requirements below.

Reference Metadata:
When writing test code, you must base it on the given, when, then data under the examples data in the Metadata.

Test Code Components:
1. Use @SpringBootTest annotation for full application context loading
2. Use ApplicationEventPublisher for event-driven communication between modules
3. Verify complete flow from event publication to event handling across modules
4. Test data validation must reference the given, when, then examples from Metadata
5. Event processing verification steps:
   - Given: Set up test data based on Metadata examples
   - When: Execute business logic that triggers event publication
   - Then: Verify event handling results in target module using Metadata validation criteria
6. Use @Transactional for test isolation and rollback
7. Verify both event publication and subsequent business logic execution
8. Assert final state changes in target module repositories
9. Mock external dependencies while keeping internal module communication intact
